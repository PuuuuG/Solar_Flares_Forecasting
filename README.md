# Solar_Flares_Forecasting

This project leverages Vision Transformer (ViT) and iTransformer models for flare forecasting. The code encompasses data preprocessing, model training, validation, and predictive testing. 

The Knowledge-informed_Features_Calculate.py file provides the code for calculating knowledge-informed features from LOS magnetograms. The ViT_Image.ipynb and iTransformer_Auto.ipynb files in the folder contain code for data processing, model definition, training, validation, and testing.
